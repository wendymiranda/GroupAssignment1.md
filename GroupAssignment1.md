# Group Assignment 1: Project Proposal 
### Research Question Introduction and Importance
For our project, we are interested in how certain built environmental factors (e.g., green spaces) and air quality (e.g., particulate matter) impact health outcomes among people living in Los Angeles County.

 What differences, based upon activities and the use of indoor appliances, can be observed among six households in the Sawtelle neighborhood of Los Angeles?
