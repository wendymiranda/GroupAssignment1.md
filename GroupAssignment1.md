# Group Assignment 1: Project Proposal 
### Research Question Introduction and Importance
For our project, we are interested in how certain built environmental factors (e.g., green spaces) and air quality (e.g., particulate matter) impact health outcomes among people living in Los Angeles County. Specifically, our research question is as follows: Does exposure to green spaces, tree canopies and particulate matter 10 and 2.5 increase risk for asthma and diabetes among people living in LA county? Furthermore, is there a relationship between green spaces/tree canopies and particulate matter 10 and 2.5 levels?

Previous literature has shown that the built environment and air quality can be predictors of health outcomes, especially respiratory diseases such as asthma (Codinhoto et al., 2009; Curtis et al., 2006). Currently, there is mixed evidence on whether green spaces may help improve asthma rates in areas with greater outdoor pollution (Alcock et al., 2017; Eisenman et al., 2019). Los Angeles county, in particular, continues to be ranked among the worst for air quality and has a shortage of green spaces (American Lung Association, 2020; KCET, 2018). Examining this relationship is in important in determining how urban planning can impact public health.
