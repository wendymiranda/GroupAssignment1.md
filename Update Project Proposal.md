# Updated Project Proposal

Research Question: Introduction and Importance
For our project, we are interested in how parks and tree canopies effect the levels of PM 2.5 in the city of Los Angeles. Specifically, our research question is as follows: Does exposure to green spaces and tree canopy coverage have an effect on particulate matter levels 2.5 in the city of Los Angeles? We may also be interested in mapping areas with health issues (like athsma and diabetes) to see if they correspond to areas of high particulate matters. If time permits we'd also like to look at socioeconomic factors and race in LA. 

There is exisisting literature that shows how access to greenspace and greenery can impact air quality. We are interested in this as well as tree canopy as they are related but separate environmental features. Los Angeles county, in particular, continues to be ranked among the worst for air quality and has a shortage of green spaces (American Lung Association, 2020; KCET, 2018). Examining this relationship is in important in determining how urban planning can impact public health. We are also seeing that green space and shade disparities fall along socioeconomic lines and contribute to disparities in quality of life. 

Spatial Scope Description:

For this project, we will be looking at the city of Los Angeles. As previously mentioned, Los Angeles does have a shortage of green spaces, however, it has been shown that certain areas have more accesibility to green spaces and tree canopies than others. Similarly, Los Angeles has an inequitable distribution of pollution in which some communities, particularly low-income and communities of color, have greater pollution than other communities. For this project, we will be looking at the city of Los Angeles to see what trends emerge as they relate to areas with greenspace access, and tree canopy coverage and pollution levels. If we can find the data we would also like to look at air quality over time to see if some areas of the city are insulated from the more extreme changes in air quality. 

Description of Data Sources:

The first data source we will use for our research project is the Healthy Places Index: https://map.healthyplacesindex.org/. This index is a tool developed by the Public Health Alliance of Southern California to explore local factors that can predict health outcomes. The data is organized geographically and broken down by census tract. Each census tract is given a Healthy Places Index (HPI) percentile score which is based on seven different categories:

Economic
Education
Transportation
Social
Neighborhood
Healthcare Access
Housing
Clean Environment
Each category is broken up into different indicators and each of these indicators are given a percentiel score in comparison to other California census tracts. We are also given a race/ ethnicity report for each census tract. We are specifically working with the neighborhood indictaor which includes park access and tree canopy. 

The second data source we will use is Cal Enviro Screen: https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-30. Cal Enviro Screen is a mapping tool that identities which California communities are most effected by different sources of pollution. The map is organized by census tract with each tract receiving a percentile score with 1-10% being the least polluted and 91-100% being the most polluted. In addition to this percentile score each tract shows the population, race/ ethnicity, and age and shows what was measured in order to determine the percentile score. For example they measure the Ozone, PM 2.5, and Pesticides for pollution measures. Athsma, low birth weight, and cardiovascular rate are measured for health vulnerability. And Education, Linguistic Isolation, Poverty, Unemployment, and Housing burden are measured for socioeconimic vulnerability.

If time permits we may work with census data to look at income and race. And we may look at PurpleAir data: https://www2.purpleair.com/ to explore air quality changes over time as well as to examine PM 10 levels. 

Intended Analysis and Visualizations:

So far we have mapped park access by census tract in LA and have maps for census tracts that have no park access as well as census tracts that have 100% park access. As well as a map looking at park count by neighborhood. And while park access can give some insight into how "green" a neighborhood is we have also mapped tree canopy coverage to give a more complete picture of the landscape and greenery of the neighborhoods. We also have histograms looking at the top 10 and lowest 10 census tracts for park access and tree canopy coverage. 

We have also mapped PM 2.5 levels by neighborhood in LA. This can provide us with more information on which neighborhood have the highest PM 2.5 levels and which neighborhood has the lowest. We also have a bar graph of the highest and lowest PM 2.5 levels by neighborhood. 

A map of the areas we research will help the reader visualize what differences exist between the areas. It may make sense to have health outcomes and pollutants/ built features on two different maps, or we may combine them if doing so does not compromise the maps legibility. We will also produce histograms that compare in greater detail the variables we measured for our geogrpahic areas.

Conclusion:

We hope to gain a greater understand of how both environmental and built features impact health outcomes. We have a good general understanding of how environemntal forces can positively or negatively impact health but we have less understanding of how built features like the maintenance of tree canopies may play into health outcomes and how these two variables relate. With this understanding we hope to identify ways in which health outcomes can be improved for an area/ community, and understand how much green spaces and tree canopies can improve air quality.
