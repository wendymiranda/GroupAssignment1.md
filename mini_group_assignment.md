**Project Title**: Built and Physical Environmental Impacts on Health Outcomes
[Project Proposal](https://github.com/wendymiranda/GroupAssignments/blob/main/GroupAssignment1.md)

**Roles**:
Sasha will work with the census and Healthy Places Index (HPI) data to explore how the census tracts we are researching scored on the categories of: 
Economic,
Education,
Transportation,
Social,
Neighborhood, 
Healthcare Access,
Housing, and
Clean Environment.
We will be looking for how these scores relate to acess to greenspace, tree coverage, and other natural features. This will involve data analysis, chart creation, map creation, and variable comparions. 
Wendy will work with the CalEnvironScreen 3.0 data base and will specifically explore pollution burden percentile, ozone, PM2.5, and asthma. 

**Status Update**: So far the initial data exploration has gone well and following the steps from lecture has been sucessful in starting to pull out data of interest. We have worked with the HPI and census data, but have not yet worked with the CalEnviroScore data.There is definitely a lot to go through and some of it will not be illuminating but speaking with Yoh we do feel like we are on the right track and will find some interesting relationsips. Recently, we have issues with sharing notebook on juypterhub. However, after visiting hours, we figured out how to clone each other's work onto juypter hub. 

**Data Update**: We will be working with the [California Healthy Places Index](https://healthyplacesindex.org/) and the [CalEnviroScreen 3.0](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-30). As of now, we have decided on what variables we will observe for each dataset, have cleaned up some of the HPI dataset, and have downloaded some census data. After cleaning up our HPI and census data, we created a few bar plots and maps that show the top census tracts with the lowest and highest household income and poverty level. We also explored which areas in Long Beach have greater tree canopy, park access, and HPI scores. We are still deciding on whether to add a third dataset for out project.

**Concerns**: 

Major concerns: 
1. In Bo's comments he mentioned doing a regression analysis on the datasets which makes sense but we may need more information on how to do this successfully in Jupyter. 
2. Another concern is that we may not find that there is a strong relationship between the variables that we are looking at. 
Minor conerns: 
1. Not having the time to explore the data in as much depth as we would like
