**Project Title**: 
[Project Proposal](https://github.com/wendymiranda/GroupAssignments/blob/main/GroupAssignment1.md)

**Roles**:
Sasha will work with the census and Healthy Places Index (HPI) data to explore how the census tracts we are researching scored on the categories of: 
Economic,
Education,
Transportation,
Social,
Neighborhood, 
Healthcare Access,
Housing, and
Clean Environment.
Wendy will work with the CalEnvironScreen 3.0 data base and will specifically explore pollution burden percentile, ozone, PM2.5, and asthma. 

**Status Update**: Recently, we have issues with sharing notebook on juypterhub. However, after visiting hours, we figured out how to clone each other's work onto juypter hub. 

**Data Update**: We will be working with the [California Healthy Places Index](https://healthyplacesindex.org/) and the [CalEnviroScreen 3.0](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-30). As of now, we have decided on what variables we will observe for each dataset. 

**Concerns**:
